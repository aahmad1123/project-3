## Description
Final Project for Full Stack Flex Web Development Bootcamp. The people who worked on this project are Asaad Ahmad and Michael Scott. We divided our workload into front-end and back-end development. Asaad took care of the former while Michael took care of the latter. 

On the client side, after scrapping the initial files and working to refactor unit 25, I (Asaad) immediately worked on getting data to display on the home page as that was the initial issue with our first draft. After getting that up and running I worked on getting the authentication features of Loggging in and Signing Up working. Finally, after those two pages and functions were up and running, I worked on the ability to add questions to the database/home page in the form of a modal.

On the server side, I generated the database and connected the database to the Apollo server. I also created the Models, Me and Assad worked together to create the typedefs, and resolvers, to query and mutate the data. I also created the authentication for the backend.
